Capabilities Finding Resources in a Azure Resource Group and identifying their dependencies. Plot nodes and edges to represent Azure Resources and their dependencies on a graph. Insert appropriate Azure Icons on basis of resource category/sub-category. Label each resource with information like Name, Category, Type etc. Generate visualization in formats like: .png and .svg Output image can be in 'light', 'dark' or 'neon' theme. Can target more than one resource group at once. Change direction in which resource groups are plotted, i.e, left-to-right or top-to-bottom.
